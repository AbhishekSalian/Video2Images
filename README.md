## About
A library which helps to convert volumetric video data into image frames with adjustable frame capturing duration functionality for video data annotation.

The main reason why I created this library is ease of video to image frames conversion. During video annotation we need individual frames of an video or a subpart of a video and that to tunable frame rate so this problems led to this library which easily helps you to do this task.

## How to install?
```pip install video2images```


## Requirements
- pip install tqdm
- pip install imageio
- pip install imageio-ffmpeg
- pip install moviepy
